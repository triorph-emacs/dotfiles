# Dotfiles

Storage of my config options from various programs

Currently running ArchLinux in a VM, using awesome-wm, kitty, neovim, obsidian and firefox as my main daily tools.

Folder layout:
- bin (executable scripts)
- fonts
- config (all my config files)
- bootstrap (scripts to setup a new VM based on the things I like to have installed)
