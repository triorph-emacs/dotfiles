## Awesome WM configuration

This is almost entirely taken from [https://github.com/elenapan/dotfiles](elenapan's awesome config).
She has thankfully made it easy to change the things you need in just a few files
while leaving the rest as is. The majority of the "changes" from her config to mine
is the stylua reformatting the code. The actual changes are:

- Because I like to have a large font on my applications, some of the "floating window size" suggestions are much too small.
- Have changed some of the default applications, such as spt instead of mpc for music.
- Added keys for my ToggleKitty script.
- Changed the default "lock screen" password to "q" and made it occur during win+l
