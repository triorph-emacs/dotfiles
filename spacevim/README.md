## SpaceVim

SpaceVim is an big config package for vim/neovim. It handles most of the config setup itself, and then loads a toml file for its things.

Config can be installed via:

```
ln -s dotfiles/spacevim ~/.SpaceVim.d
```

You still have to install SpaceVim itself the normal way.

This is what I'm currently using, but it seems to me like SpaceVim has some defaults I'm not super happy with, and furthermore because it is both vim and neovim compatible, it is not using all of the featureset of neovim that I would like it to be. My next step is to use the list of "supported packages" in the tokyonight theme as a guide for packages I should try to install manually. This is here for semi-posterity, but technically I am also using this right now.
